##Features (which may not be as noticeable in the youtube video)

1) Audio events are implemented for all three puzzles
2) There is one particle system in the candle, and 2 custom shaders, one for the candle, and the other for the object used to denote key color which glows when slotted in the correct door
   The glowing spheres also use a custom shade
